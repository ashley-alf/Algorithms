Hello
The libraries you will need to download are:
    - pip install PyDictionary
    - Note: for some reason PyDictionary is missing
    vital words like "the", "him", ect. If you type
    a word you know it exists, but it says it doesn't
    it might be a problem with PyDictionary, and they should
    update that, but it's a not a problem of the code.
if you get an error trying to install Pydictionary
try the following command:
    - pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    - pip install PyDictionary

Once you have that done then you want to type into the
commandline:
    - python playBoggle.py
Then it will ask you other questions.
To begin type server and give whatever address and port
you want to connect to. Then in another command line
choose to be a client and connect to the corresponding
address and port of the server
