This is a Boggle game played with two players over a network. 

The libraries you will need to download are:
    - pip install PyDictionary

if you get an error trying to install Pydictionary
try the following command:
    - pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    - pip install PyDictionary

Once you have done that then you want to type into the
commandline:
    - python playBoggle.py
Then it will ask you other questions.
To begin type server and give whatever address and port
you want to connect to. Then in another command line
choose to be a client and connect to the corresponding
address and port of the server
